# How to solve the questions in the VM?

1. Log in to the VM using `ssh <roll-number>@cs1102.study.iitm.ac.in`

2. To view all the available questions in the directory

```bash
ls /opt/cs1102
```

![](/images/asignment_question_directory.png)

3. Create a directory in your home folder using `mkdir cs1102` and navigate to the directory `cd cs1102`

![](/images/cs1102_dir_creation.png)

4. Your command prompt should now look like this:

<div style="background-color:white">
<span style="color: green;">\<roll-number\>@cs1102</span>:<span style="color: blue;">~/cs1102</span>$
</div>

5. Solve each question by creating a directory named after the question(example `practice_2.1`)

```bash
mkdir practice_2.1
cd practice_2.1
```

6. After navigating to the `practice_2.1` directory, type `synchro show` to view the question

7. Solve the question by either writing the script `<script>.sh` or by executing commands directly in the command line, as instructed in the question

8. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run the script. If not, change the script's permissions using `chmod 755 <script>.sh`

9. Run `synchro eval` to submit the question. It will display the submission status and show how many test cases you have passed or failed

10. To view the public test cases and evaluation script for the question, navigate to `~/opt/cs1102/<question>`

:::{.callout-important}
- **`synchro init`** - to iniatilize or bring all the neccessary files to solve the problem
- **`synchro show`** - to view the question
- **`synchro eval`** - to submit and evaluate the question

All these commands needs to be executed within the directory (`~/cs1102/<question>`)

- **`synchro status`** - to view the number of questions you have solved

All the instructions are also available in the course VM itself. You can read them by `batcat ~/README.md`
